Little is known about its organisation. This study uses 350 CVs of former IRA employees to provide insights into its structure and evolution (2013–2021). It shows that the IRA recruited mainly young, inexperienced individuals from St Petersburg universities, with a spike in recruitment when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. This study details the IRA’s hierarchical structure and integration into the Russian media labour market, providing a framework for understanding similar disinformation organisations worldwide for the benefit of policymakers and researchers. Prigozhin’s digital influence empire, which included the IRA and his media company, Patriot Media Group, was dissolved following the mutiny led by Prigozhin’s Wagner Group in June 2023.</div></section></div><hr /><div class="article-notes"><div class="copyright">© 2026 The Author(s).

The initial discovery of the IRA by Russian and Western journalists in September 2013 and June 2015, respectively, led to the coining of the term ‘troll farm’ (Chen <a href="#CIT0010" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0010" epub:type="biblioref">2015</a>) or ‘troll factory’ (Garmazhapova <a href="#CIT0020" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0020" epub:type="biblioref">2013</a>) to describe institutionalised groups of digital workers whose objective is to influence the political discourse and decision-making dynamics of a particular society (Burgess <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0009" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0009" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>). The IRA was controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who maintained a close relationship with Russia’s autocrat Vladimir Putin (Walker &amp; Sauer <a href="#CIT0049" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0049" epub:type="biblioref">2023</a>). Prigozhin also founded the mercenary Wagner Group (Marten <a href="#CIT0037" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0037" epub:type="biblioref">2019</a>). He was killed in a plane crash on 23 August 2023, exactly two months after his mutiny against the Kremlin and subsequent fall from Putin’s grace. The IRA and its activities have been scrutinised in an entire strand of academic literature<a href="#FN0001" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and through extensive investigative reporting (Garmazhapova <a href="#CIT0020" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0020" epub:type="biblioref">2013</a>; Soshnikov <a href="#CIT0045" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0045" epub:type="biblioref">2013</a>; Chen <a href="#CIT0010" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0010" epub:type="biblioref">2015</a>). The IRA’s coordinated information operation targeting the 2016 US presidential elections was one of the ‘most studied of the social media age’ (Ehrett <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0016" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0016" epub:type="biblioref">2021</a>, p. 1595). Extant research, however, has almost exclusively drawn upon analysis of content posted by inauthentic IRA accounts as identified by the leading social media platforms Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.<a href="#FN0002" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> We have virtually no systematically collected academic knowledge on how the IRA functioned as an organisation, about its workforce, their tasks and the development of this highly secretive organisation over time. What we presently know about the IRA as an organisation is largely based on investigative reporting that draws on the testimonials of a very small number of whistleblowers, recorded at specific points in time.<a href="#FN0003" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></div><div role="paragraph">Our study seeks to fill this gap in academic knowledge by tapping entirely novel data. In spring 2022, we downloaded 350 <i>curricula vitae</i> (CVs), which former staff members of the IRA had self-published on Russia’s two primary job search platforms: HeadHunter (hh.ru) and SuperJob (superjob.ru). In these web profiles, individuals described their IRA employment to appeal to future employers. Using an open source intelligence (OSINT) approach (Hassan &amp; Hijazi <a href="#CIT0025" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0025" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>), which has already been used to define Prigozhin as one of Russia’s ‘entrepreneurs of influence’ (Laruelle &amp; Limonier <a href="#CIT0032" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0032" epub:type="biblioref">2021</a>, p. 318) and to study Russian hybrid aggression in Donbas (Hauter <a href="#CIT0026" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0026" epub:type="biblioref">2023</a>), we were able to investigate Russian companies without field access, in a war-waging, increasingly repressive authoritarian country.</div><div role="paragraph">Based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of these CVs, this study creates systematic knowledge, covering almost one decade of the IRA’s existence (2013–2021), about the demographics and qualifications of the IRA’s workforce, the work practices of these individuals, how the IRA was organised, and how it was perceived as an employer by other Russian (media) companies. Our data demonstrate that in the period 2013–2021, the IRA mainly employed people in their early twenties, with no or little work experience, and with degrees from St Petersburg universities. A spike in recruitment activity coincided with Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014. A qualitative analysis of the CV dataset also provides detailed insights into the internal organisation of the IRA, revealing a broad five-level hierarchy.</div><div role="paragraph">This study is the first detailed attempt to examine the organisational structure of a ‘troll factory’ and how it developed over almost a decade of operation. It advances the understanding of similar ‘disinformation-for-hire’ (Grohmann &amp; Ong <a href="#CIT0022" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0022" epub:type="biblioref">2024</a>, p. 1) organisations. In particular, it contributes to the findings of Ayeb and Bonini (<a href="#CIT0002" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0002" epub:type="biblioref">2024</a>), who locate such organisations in the media industry market, as our examination of the subsequent career paths of former IRA staff shows that the IRA—despite functioning as a covert disinformation organisation—was integrated into the Russian labour market for media and communication professionals, with a significant proportion of former staff moving seamlessly into positions in sales and marketing, social media marketing and journalism.</div><div role="paragraph">The IRA is arguably the best-known ‘troll farm’ to date and has received a lot of media attention. While many of the empirical findings of this study are descriptive and concern only one ‘disinformation-for-hire’ organisation (Grohmann &amp; Ong <a href="#CIT0022" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0022" epub:type="biblioref">2024</a>, p. 1), they fill important gaps in academic knowledge about such entities. The solid descriptive knowledge provided here can serve as a basis for future research on the specific organisational processes and characteristics of the IRA and comparable entities across the world.</div><div role="paragraph">The remainder of the article is organised as follows. In the next section, we review the existing research on how disinformation-for-hire is organised globally. The following section reviews the IRA with a specific focus on how it functioned as an organisation. Addressing key gaps in this literature, a subsequent section develops four specific research questions, referring also to gaps in knowledge left by extant investigative journalism. After a section on methods, we present our findings and the conclusion discusses how this study contributes to our understanding of the IRA and the organisational strategies of the global disinformation industry.</div><section id="sec-1"><h2>The disinformation industry: the challenges of studying covert organisations</h2><div role="paragraph">Since the discovery of the IRA in 2013, the world has witnessed the emergence and growth of a new segment of the media market: the disinformation production industry, which has undergone a process of professionalisation and diversification (Grohmann &amp; Ong <a href="#CIT0022" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0022" epub:type="biblioref">2024</a>). This industry consists of institutionalised collectivities of digital labour whose aim is to influence the dynamics of political discourse and decision-making in a given society (Burgess <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0009" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0009" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>). Some of these actors seek to exert influence in multiple societies, intending to affect the policies of foreign countries. Organisations in this industry have been called ‘troll factories’ (Linvill &amp; Warren <a href="#CIT0034" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0034" epub:type="biblioref">2020</a>, p. 447), ‘troll farms’ (Freelon <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0019" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0019" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>, p. 561), ‘fake news factories’ (Bergmann <a href="#CIT0004" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0004" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>, p. 152), ‘digital mercenaries’ (DiResta <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0014" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0014" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>, p. 222) and ‘digital black ops’ (Ong &amp; Cabañes <a href="#CIT0038" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0038" epub:type="biblioref">2019</a>, p. 5771). These kinds of organisations have been detected in China (Han <a href="#CIT0023" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0023" epub:type="biblioref">2015</a>), the Philippines (Ong &amp; Cabañes <a href="#CIT0038" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0038" epub:type="biblioref">2019</a>), Turkey (Bulut &amp; Yörük <a href="#CIT0008" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0008" epub:type="biblioref">2017</a>), Brazil (Ozawa <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0039" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0039" epub:type="biblioref">2023</a>) and South Korea (Keller <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0029" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0029" epub:type="biblioref">2020</a>).</div><div role="paragraph">Academic inquiry into this industry faces considerable methodological and theoretical challenges. The covert nature of these organisations makes it difficult for researchers to gather information about them. Much of the published academic literature on disinformation organisations relies on the datasets of content attributed to these organisations published by the major Western social media companies (Facebook, Twitter) (Bastos &amp; Farkas <a href="#CIT0003" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0003" epub:type="biblioref">2019</a>; Linvill <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0035" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0035" epub:type="biblioref">2021</a>; DiResta <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0014" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0014" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>). The practice of publishing these datasets also began with the release of IRA data in 2018 by Meta. From then on, social media companies regularly published data identified as ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’,<a href="#FN0004" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> mostly content from foreign disinformation organisations attempting to interfere in other countries’ elections.</div><div role="paragraph">Observing that disinformation production is part of the global media production market, Ong and Cabañes (<a href="#CIT0038" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0038" epub:type="biblioref">2019</a>) were the first to apply methods previously used to study traditional media organisations to disinformation production. In their study, they used interviews combined with participant observation to study disinformation producers in the Philippines. Following these steps, Ayeb and Bonini (<a href="#CIT0002" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0002" epub:type="biblioref">2024</a>) conducted interviews with eight disinformation workers in the Arab world. These interviews provided an insight into the work routines and feelings of those working in the disinformation organisations.</div><div role="paragraph">Nevertheless, the covert nature of these organisations left the following challenges for future studies. First, as most of these organisations are located in countries that do not qualify as fully consolidated liberal democracies, sometimes in autocratic contexts, it is difficult for researchers to reach their employees. Thus, studies are based on a small number of interviews. Second, some aspects of the structure and operation of such organisations may be unknown to the interviewees; for example, respondents in the Ayeb and Bonini (<a href="#CIT0002" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0002" epub:type="biblioref">2024</a>) study did not know who owned the companies they worked for. Third, as some of these organisations work on a project basis, it is difficult to show how such an organisation might have changed in the course of its existence.</div><div role="paragraph">To expand knowledge about the efforts of such organisations, in this article we propose to study the IRA, a disinformation organisation that existed for at least a decade, using a novel method of collecting relatively large datasets on the organisation itself rather than the content it produced.</div></section><section id="sec-2"><h2>Prior research on the IRA: a focus on content</h2><div role="paragraph">In the wake of its information operation targeting the 2016 US presidential election, the IRA has been widely scrutinised academically.<a href="#FN0005" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This concerted effort has produced, among other things, detailed knowledge about the argumentative tactics employed by IRA accounts (Linvill <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0033" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0033" epub:type="biblioref">2019</a>; Rains <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0042" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0042" epub:type="biblioref">2021</a>), how IRA accounts appeared as <i>vox populi</i> in US news (Lukito <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0036" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0036" epub:type="biblioref">2020</a>), how the IRA promoted pseudoscientific content (Strudwicke &amp; Grant <a href="#CIT0047" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0047" epub:type="biblioref">2020</a>), how these social media accounts covered Russia’s hybrid warfare in Donbas in 2014 (Doroshenko &amp; Lukito <a href="#CIT0015" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0015" epub:type="biblioref">2021</a>) as well as their propagation of racist (Freelon <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0019" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0019" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>) and anti-feminist attitudes (Bradshaw &amp; Henle <a href="#CIT0006" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0006" epub:type="biblioref">2021</a>). Scholars have also proposed a typology of inauthentic IRA profiles, distinguishing between ‘right troll, left troll, news feed, hashtag gamer, and fearmonger’ accounts (Linvill &amp; Warren <a href="#CIT0034" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0034" epub:type="biblioref">2020</a>, p. 447).<a href="#FN0006" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> In addition to examining the content posted by IRA accounts, researchers have drawn on a second source of data: social media ads purchased by the IRA. These datasets of ads linked to the IRA have been identified and made available to researchers by the data analytics teams of leading social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook. For example, using one of these ad datasets, Al-Rawi and Rahman (<a href="#CIT0001" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0001" epub:type="biblioref">2020</a>) examined how the IRA microtargeted audiences in the US according to their race, sex, and political and religious beliefs. As this brief review shows, academic research on the IRA in recent years has two common features that can be applied to the global literature on disinformation-producing organisations. First, the majority of studies are based on the analysis of the content published by inauthentic accounts operated by the IRA.<a href="#FN0007" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Second, in terms of identifying troll accounts, academic research has almost exclusively relied on datasets provided by social media platforms.<a href="#FN0008" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></div></section><section id="sec-3"><h2>Identifying research gaps: lack of knowledge about the IRA as an organisation</h2><div role="paragraph">In contrast, what we presently know about the IRA’s staff, its organisational structures and its historical development is largely based on think tank reports, government documents, and journalistic articles.<a href="#FN0009" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> To the best of our knowledge, no academic study has set out to create systematic knowledge about how the IRA functioned as an organisation, for instance, by conducting interviews with former IRA employees. The lack of this type of research is most likely due to a wealth of practical and ethical concerns, including potential negative repercussions for both the interviewees and the researchers, political self-censorship by academics both in Russia and abroad who potentially face threats from Russia’s repressive regime, and the scarcity of language skills and cultural knowledge about Russia in the global community of communication researchers. As we have already noted, the same problem is faced by researchers of other disinformation production organisations around the world, which results in a limited ability to capture the inner workings of these organisations using traditional methods. As a result, there is a dearth of systematically generated knowledge about the disinformation workforce and, in particular, about IRA operatives, their roles, and the functioning and development of the organisation.</div><div role="paragraph">In this context, from a methodological point of view, this study is the first to investigate a communication organisation by analysing professional profiles posted by former employees on job search platforms. This OSINT approach originated in the field of intelligence studies, where it is defined as a set of methods and tools that facilitate ‘the collection of intelligence by exploiting publicly available resources’ (Hassan &amp; Hijazi <a href="#CIT0025" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0025" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>, p. 1). Using this approach, our study examines interactions in the job market and provides insights into trends in the disinformation-for-hire market.</div></section><section id="sec-4"><h2>Research questions</h2><div role="paragraph">As we have noted before, the IRA is the quintessential disinformation-for-hire collective, giving the industry at least two of the names for its typical units (‘troll factory’ and ‘troll farm’). The existing gaps in our knowledge of the IRA also apply to the larger gaps about the inner workings of the other disinformation-for-hire collectives around the world. The IRA has been known to the public since 2013, so this section details the existing knowledge about the IRA in four areas, describes its contradictions and weaknesses, and then specifies four research questions that target these areas.</div><section id="sec-4-1"><h3>RQ1: Socio-demographics and qualifications of IRA staff</h3><div role="paragraph">The first of the areas for which only rudimentary, and even partly contradictory, knowledge is available concerns the socio-demographics of the IRA’s workforce. Information about gender diversity, for instance, is inconclusive with one source (Patrikarakos <a href="#CIT0040" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0040" epub:type="biblioref">2017</a>) claiming that IRA staff was mostly female. In a similar vein, details such as their age, citizenship, educational background, linguistic abilities, previous work experience and subsequent career paths remain largely unknown. To fill in this first set of gaps, we formulate the following two questions. First, what were the socio-demographics of the staff hired by the IRA, including age, gender, citizenship, education and language skills? Second, how long did staff work for the IRA and what were their prior and subsequent places of employment?</div></section><section id="sec-4-2"><h3>RQ2: Development of the IRA as an organisation over time</h3><div role="paragraph">We have limited information from journalistic reports on the creation of the IRA and the evolution of its workforce. The US Department of Justice (<a href="#CIT0048" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>) legally identifies the IRA as a network of seven camouflage companies based in St Petersburg: the Internet Research LLC; MediaSintez LLC; GlavSet LLC; MixInfo LLC; Azimut LLC; NovInfo LLC; and the Internet Research Agency LLC from which journalists/the US Department of Justice (<a href="#CIT0048" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>) derived the network’s name. However, official registration periods of these camouflage companies do not always match the observations of investigative journalists on the operations of the IRA network (Rusyayeva &amp; Zakharov <a href="#CIT0044" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0044" epub:type="biblioref">2017</a>).</div><div role="paragraph">From journalistic reports, we have sketchy knowledge of how the IRA was created and how its workforce developed over time. In 2018, a former associate of Prigozhin, Andrey Mikhaylov, stated that the IRA had 200 employees in 2013 (Korotkov <a href="#CIT0030" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0030" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>). In late 2014, a whistleblower estimated that ‘about 400 people occupied four floors of an office building and worked 12-hour shifts’ (Davlashyan &amp; Titova <a href="#CIT0012" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0012" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>). On 6 July 2015, investigative journalist Andrei Soshnikov counted 300 employees entering and leaving the office between 8am and 11am (Soshnikov <a href="#CIT0046" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0046" epub:type="biblioref">2015</a>). As a result, we have little reliable information about when the IRA companies were active and how many people they employed. Therefore, we ask, how did the workforce of the IRA network develop over time?</div></section><section id="sec-4-3"><h3>RQ3: Departments, job roles and hierarchies at the IRA</h3><div role="paragraph">In parallel to the formal division of the IRA into seven legal entities (see above), the Mueller indictment (US Department of Justice <a href="#CIT0048" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>) and journalistic sources feature various listings of IRA subunits. According to the US Department of Justice (<a href="#CIT0048" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>, pp. 4–5), the IRA comprised: ‘a graphics department; a data analysis department; a search-engine optimisation (“SEO”) department; an information-technology (“IT”) department … and a finance department to budget and allocate funding’. That said, from these sources, it is not entirely clear, first, whether these and other subunits existed across the IRA network or within specific legal entities and, second, whether different terms were used to refer to the same subunits. Moreover, they use different labels to refer to the same sub-entities. For example, the most notorious sub-entity, allegedly tasked with interfering with the 2016 US election, is variously referred to as the ‘US/American department’ (Rusyayeva &amp; Zakharov <a href="#CIT0044" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0044" epub:type="biblioref">2017</a>) and the ‘Translator project’ (US Department of Justice <a href="#CIT0048" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>, p. 6). In summary, we have limited knowledge of the departmental structure of the IRA, a far more sketchy understanding of the inner workings of the departments, whether they operated within or across legal entities, and what proportion of IRA staff were allocated to what tasks. Therefore, we ask, what subunits and job roles existed within which legal entities of the IRA network?</div><div role="paragraph">A related area of knowledge concerns hierarchy levels at the IRA. Sorted by supposedly decreasing hierarchy level, extant sources identify the following roles: chief executive officer (CEO, director general), (deputy) heads/managers of projects/departments, team leads, editors-in-chief, bloggers, content managers, SEO specialists and illustrators. Journalists claimed that within the IRA ‘a classic scheme is used: a single head and line supervisors’ (Rusyayeva &amp; Zakharov <a href="#CIT0044" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0044" epub:type="biblioref">2017</a>). To advance knowledge in this area, we ask what can be learned from our data about the IRA’s hierarchical organisation.</div></section><section id="sec-4-4"><h3>RQ4: Targeted platforms, tools and partners</h3><div role="paragraph">Our knowledge about what platforms the IRA targeted and its tools and partners is incomplete and anecdotal. In terms of targeted platforms, the Mueller indictment (US Department of Justice <a href="#CIT0048" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>) stated that the IRA operated on the following social media platforms: YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Liudmila Savchuk, one of the IRA’s whistleblowers, told journalists that the IRA also operated on the Russian platforms Livejournal and Odnoklassniki (Bidder <a href="#CIT0005" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0005" epub:type="biblioref">2015</a>). To confirm and expand on this we interrogate our CV dataset and related previous anecdotal knowledge of the IRA’s target platforms, tools and partners, we examine what we can learn from the CV dataset about the platforms targeted, the technological tools used and the external partners involved by the IRA.</div></section></section><section id="sec-5" data-type="methods"><h2>Methods</h2><section id="sec-5-1"><h3>Sampling and data collection</h3><div role="paragraph">The goal of our sampling strategy was to collect professional web profiles (CVs) of individuals who had worked for the IRA. To do so, we searched for all known IRA-affiliated entities<a href="#FN0010" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> on the two websites HeadHunter (hh.ru) and SuperJob (superjob.ru). In 2019, the shares in the Russian online recruiting market of these two platforms were estimated at 45% and 19%, respectively (Bryzgalova &amp; Petlevoy <a href="#CIT0007" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0007" epub:type="biblioref">2019</a>). Deploying these search terms in an exploratory stage in November 2021 and then in February and March 2022, we manually downloaded 393 web profiles.</div><div role="paragraph">Each CV features a text box that allows owners to describe their tasks at the IRA in their own words. This text provides a wealth of unstructured knowledge about the tasks of the IRA, written by its staff. It offers a unique and diverse insight into their tasks, including targeted web platforms, IT tools and collaborations (answering RQ4).</div></section><section id="sec-5-2"><h3>Potential biases owing to self-selection and social desirability</h3><div role="paragraph">Some elements of the quantitative data analysis (RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3) depend on the assumption that our sample of CVs is broadly representative of the population of CVs of individuals who worked for the IRA. As we see in the answer to RQ2, our sample is quite large in terms of numbers compared to the total IRA population documented by journalists. Other elements of the qualitative analysis (RQ2 and RQ4) rely on the assumption that the individuals who self-published the CVs reported on some aspects of their IRA work experience, at least overall, truthfully.</div><div role="paragraph">Based on these assumptions, the first type of bias that our data may suffer from is self-selection bias, as all individuals self-selected their CVs into the sample by uploading their profiles to a job search platform. Our estimate of a specific characteristic of the IRA workforce (such as gender, age, university degree, see RQ1) will thus be distorted if individuals with some particular characteristics are less likely than other individuals to post their profiles on these recruitment websites or to include their IRA work experience on their CVs. We have no grounds to believe that our sample suffers from self-selection bias concerning most characteristics, including gender, age, university degree or duration of stay at the IRA. On the other hand, in terms of subsequent work experience, we cannot rule out the possibility that those who were less likely to list an IRA affiliation on their CVs were individuals who moved into the segment of the market where an association with the IRA entities indicted in the US could be detrimental (such as non-state-controlled media or Western companies). That said, a significant number of individuals in our dataset moved on to large Western retail brands, even after occupying leadership roles at the IRA.</div><div role="paragraph">A second type of bias may result from the fact that the CVs were uploaded, or last updated, at different points in time. While approximately 55% (<i>n </i>=<span data-style="sans-serif"> 193</span>) of CVs were updated within two years before we collected the data in March 2022, approximately 20.57% (<i>n </i>=<span data-style="sans-serif"> 72</span>) of CVs were older than five years.<a href="#FN0011" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> As CVs can only cover work experiences before the last update of the CV, we can plausibly assume that elements of the analysis tracing developments over time (RQ2) will slightly overestimate frequencies for earlier periods.</div><div role="paragraph">The third type of bias that our dataset may suffer from is social desirability. As the profiles were published on a job-seeking website, it is plausible to assume that individuals describe their work experiences in a way that they believe makes them attractive to their future employers. That said, all individuals in the dataset considered their work experience at the IRA an asset to their professional profiles, as they did not omit their affiliation with the IRA from their CVs. As a close reading of the text boxes yields, individuals included in the dataset had no feelings of shame or guilt over their IRA activities, nor any fear of prosecution at home or abroad.<a href="#FN0012" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This perception is confirmed by the fact that many of the individuals, after their time at the IRA, found well-paid jobs in the non-political or government-affiliated segment of the labour market. At the same time, we assume that CVs might, by their nature, overstate qualifications, skills and achievements. In general, we assume that a sugar-coated version of all work experiences is narrated in the CVs, omitting weaknesses, failures and conflicts and exaggerating the contributions and skills of the author.</div><div role="paragraph">Overall, we have high confidence in the findings as we present them in the following sections. For instance, we could identify no plausible reason to believe that the descriptive statistics reported in response to RQ1 are not broadly generalisable from the sample of CVs collected to the population of interest (that is, the IRA’s workforce). That said, if we have doubts concerning the accuracy or validity of specific claims, we reveal those and contextualise our claims at the specific points in the findings section where we present them (see, for instance, our response to RQ3).</div></section><section id="sec-5-3"><h3>Data analysis and research ethics</h3><div role="paragraph">We wrote JavaScript code to automatically extract relevant information from the collected profiles. After manually removing or merging the information of 43 duplicate profiles, we obtained a JSON dataset of 350 unique CVs. After data collection and pre-processing, two Russian native speakers manually coded each non-IRA workplace into one of the predefined categories, based on the information provided in the CVs and additional information about the companies found on the web. An inter-coder reliability test showed a satisfactory level of agreement (Krippendorff’s α =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 0</span>.947). We cleaned the data for the following variables: level of education, international experience, university city and field of study. Then we manually grouped the data provided in the CVs for two additional variables: type of job at IRA and type of job at other workplaces.<a href="#FN0013" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></div><div role="paragraph">In a subsequent qualitative step of the analysis, one of the authors of this study read all 350 profiles, with particular attention to the free text fields where CV authors provided details about their work experience. This qualitative coding effort was implemented with the help of the software MaxQDA and broadly followed a grounded theory logic, implementing the two steps of open and axial coding to generate categories inductively. In this qualitative coding effort, we were able to map all mentions of departments/projects, all mentions of the estimated size of these departments, and all hints as to hierarchical structures and tasks executed by specific positions.<a href="#FN0014" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></div><div role="paragraph">Data collection, processing and storage were implemented according to a rigorous ethics protocol that complied with European data protection law and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Passau. The research procedures developed aimed at guaranteeing, most importantly, that none of the individuals whose CVs are included in our dataset is identifiable by a leak of data from the authors’ research unit, by the dataset published or <i>via</i> published research articles. The ethics provisions stipulated that all data had to be pseudonymised immediately after collection and stored securely during the process of data analysis, and that only (translated) literal quotes from CVs that do not allow for identification of CV owners were published.</div></section></section><section id="sec-6"><h2>Findings</h2><section id="sec-6-1"><h3>RQ1: Socio-demographics, career paths and language skills</h3><div role="paragraph">To identify the socio-demographic characteristics of IRA employees and to demonstrate their career paths, we present information on gender, time of employment, citizenship, age, education and career after the IRA in <a href="t0001.xhtml">Table 1</a>.

As our data indicate, the IRA network was created in a massive recruiting effort between approximately June 2013 and October 2014. A particularly steep increase in staff can be identified between early and mid-2014, coinciding broadly with Russia’s annexation of Crimea. In the first quarter of 2014 alone, 51 individuals (14.6% of IRA staff in our dataset) were hired (see Figure 1). The size of the agency then decreased only slightly until the summer of 2016, when it shrank massively by approximately half its employees. The data thus clearly document a pronounced decrease in IRA staff in the months before the US presidential elections of 8 November 2016. Twenty-seven former staff (approximately 7.7% of all individuals included in our dataset) left the IRA in August 2016 alone (see Figure 1). As these findings indicate, the IRA was not an organisation that was primarily set up, or specifically harnessed and funded, with an eye to the 2016 US presidential elections (see also data on language skills). Moreover, as the CV data demonstrate, there were several camouflage companies, which seemed to exist to a certain degree independently of being officially registered. As the CV data show, many camouflage companies employed IRA workers even years after their formal closure between 2017 and 2019, potentially paying their staff in cash.<a href="#FN0016" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> The operation of several companies that comprised the IRA (according to the US indictment) continued until early 2022, the endpoint of our data collection.

In these fields, individuals frequently mentioned a subunit they were affiliated with, referred to variously as ‘departments’, ‘projects’ or ‘directions’. Typical examples of such subunits were ‘the information department’, ‘the editorial department’, ‘the LiveJournal project’, the ‘exclusives and special investigations department’ and the ‘Middle East Direction’.<a href="#FN0017" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> As both quantitative analysis and in-depth reading of the CV data suggest, the IRA network was thus composed of a combination of first ‘static’ subunits that existed throughout the analysis, such as the ‘information’ department. In parallel, the IRA featured a multitude of variously labelled, highly informal subunits that existed for limited periods and were typically organised around specific projects such as communication campaigns targeting specific platforms or events. At a more abstract level, the job roles and subunits mentioned were working towards performing broadly six tasks, described below.</div><section id="sec-6-3-1"><h4>Mimicking ordinary citizens</h4><div role="paragraph">The first type of task was aimed at mimicking ordinary citizens’ voices, that is, producing seemingly ‘user-generated’ content. It was described as ‘maintaining social media accounts’ (M, 20, content manager) and ‘creating engagement in comments’ (M, 24, content manager). CVs in this category most frequently claimed affiliation with an ‘information department’ (29 mentions). Other CVs referred to a ‘copywriting department’ (2), a ‘blogosphere (blogging) department’ (2), an ‘information law department’ (1), an ‘information-analytical department’ (1), a ‘content department’ (1), a blogosphere department (1), and a ‘department of blogging and copywriting’ (1). The job role most often provided in the CVs for these positions was that of a ‘content manager’ (<i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 194</span>, 55.27% of all CVs).</div></section><section id="sec-6-3-2"><h4>Mimicking journalism</h4><div role="paragraph">A second type of job role and subunit was primarily dedicated to mimicking journalistic content by producing (inauthentic) IRA news websites or social media news accounts. It was referred to as ‘positive coverage of the government’ (F, 32, journalist), ‘filling company websites and social media accounts’ (M, 25, editor) and ‘translating foreign articles’ (F, 25, editor). These job roles were typically described as ‘journalist’ or ‘editor’ (16.8%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 59</span>) or ‘proofreader’ (3.13%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 11</span>). Subunits frequently mentioned by these CV holders were ‘editorial department’, ‘media holding’ (not specified further) or RIA FAN, the name of a news organisation that was part of Prigozhin’s PMG.</div></section><section id="sec-6-3-3"><h4>Advertising and marketing</h4><div role="paragraph">A third type of job role was dedicated to implementing advertising and marketing campaigns, which we understand as including the tasks of social media marketing (SMM) and search engine optimisation (SEO). Tasks and achievements cited in the CVs included ‘increasing monthly social traffic by up to 40%’ (F, 19, SEO specialist), ‘developing and implementing algorithms to promote content on social media platforms abroad’ (F, 23, SMM specialist) and even ‘propaganda, political PR’ (M, 44, SMM specialist). The most frequently mentioned job roles in this category were that of ‘marketing specialists’ (2.28%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 8</span>), ‘SEO specialists’ (1.99%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 7</span>) and ‘social media marketing SMM specialists’ (5.7%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 20</span>). Affiliations included ‘SEO department’ (3), ‘(internet) marketing department’ (3), ‘department of contextual advertising’ (1), ‘marketing department’ (1), and ‘department set up to create and promote an online shop’ (1).</div></section><section id="sec-6-3-4"><h4>Media monitoring and analysis</h4><div role="paragraph">A fourth type of subunit was tasked with media monitoring and analysis. Tasks were defined as ‘analysing the present political situation in the United States’ (F, 23, analyst), ‘formulating an all-inclusive media strategy’ (M, 24, lead analyst) and ‘reviewing employee key performance indicators, employee morale’ (M, 27, analyst). The most frequent job role in this category of CV was that of ‘analyst’ (3.42%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 12</span>). Analysts claimed to be affiliated with an ‘analytical department’ (1), a ‘department of analytics’ (1), a ‘department of analytics and monitoring’ (1), and a ‘department of social media and media monitoring’ (1).</div></section><section id="sec-6-3-5"><h4>Visual propaganda</h4><div role="paragraph">Fifth, the IRA employed staff specialising in video and image production. This work was described as ‘creating viral cartoons’ (M, 26, designer), ‘comics creation on political topics’ (M, 31, designer) and ‘artistic design of gift products for dignitaries of various states’ (M, 31, designer). Job roles included ‘designers’ and ‘video producers’ (5.7%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 20</span>). These individuals claimed to be affiliated with a ‘video department’ (1), a ‘video production department’ (1), a ‘creative department’ (2), or a ‘designers department’ (1).</div></section><section id="sec-6-3-6"><h4>Administrative and technical support</h4><div role="paragraph">The complexity of the IRA’s organisation is illustrated by the fact that it operated a whole range of subunits dedicated to specific administrative and technical tasks. These tasks included information technology (IT) support provided by ‘IT specialists’ (<i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 12</span> mentions) working for an ‘IT department’ (2 mentions), server administration provided by a ‘server administration department’ (2), cleaning provided by personnel (2) in a ‘cleaning department’ (2), ‘human resources specialists’ (4) in a ‘human resources department’ (1), office managers (4), accountants (3) in an accounting department, a legal department (1), and security personnel (2). The security staff, for example, was responsible (according to the descriptions in the CVs) for carrying out internal investigations, organising access controls to the company’s offices and issuing security passes.</div></section><section id="sec-6-3-7"><h4>Hierarchical organisation</h4><div role="paragraph">A close reading of the CVs revealed broadly five levels of hierarchy which were widely applicable across the subunits of types 1–5 mentioned above (see <a href="f0002.xhtml">Figure 2</a>).<figure id="F0002" class="graphic" epub:type="figure"><a href="f0002.xhtml"><img src="../graphic/ceas_a_2588334_f0002_ob.jpg" style="width: min(100%,500px);" data-height="638" data-width="1500" aria-labelledby="F0002" /></a><figcaption><span class="heading">Figure 2</span>.

Individuals affiliated with the information department, for instance, implemented the simplest ‘trolling’ tasks such as posting comments on news websites or social media (8.83% of all CVs, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 31</span>). In 25 (7.12%) CVs, these individuals had been promoted to the next level (7.12% of all CVs, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 25</span>), comprising job roles referred to as ‘content manager’, ‘category 1 specialist, information department’, <b>‘</b>copywriter’, ‘blogger’ or ‘journalist’. These second-level positions involved more sophisticated content production, administrative tasks (writing daily reports, curating photo archives) and, often, the management of teams of entry-level ‘specialists’ (62.5%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 219</span>). At the third level of the hierarchy, we identified team leaders who were referred to as ‘editors’ in the departments producing journalistic content (7.69%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 27</span>) and as ‘lead specialists’ in other departments (5.41%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 19</span>). As can be seen from the CVs, these individuals were still involved in operational tasks in their sub-units but devoted most of their time to management and administrative tasks. At the fourth level of the hierarchy were deputy heads of department (1.71%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 6</span>) and editors-in-chief (3.99%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 14</span>). The latter managed entire projects and communicated with top management. At the fifth level, our CVs included two CVs of chief executive officers (0.57%, <i>n</i> =<span data-style="sans-serif"> 2</span>), each of whom supervised several departments.</div></section></section><section id="sec-6-4"><h3>RQ4: Targeted platforms, tools and partners</h3><section id="sec-6-4-1"><h4>Platforms targeted</h4><div role="paragraph">A close reading of the text entered by the 350 individuals into the job description fields provides a comprehensive overview of the platforms on which the IRA was active. These included not only Twitter, Facebook and Instagram but also Telegram and YouTube. In addition, according to the CV data, the IRA operated on TikTok and Tumblr as well as across all major Russia-based platforms, including the social media platforms LiveJournal, VK (Vkontakte, a Russia-based social media platform broadly comparable to Facebook), OK (<i>Odnoklassniki</i>, another Russia-based social media platform), Yandex.News (the news aggregator of the Russia-based search engine Yandex), the news recommendation platform Yandex.Zen, <i>Kinopoisk</i> (a Russia-based movie and review database broadly comparable to IMDB) and Pikabu.</div><div role="paragraph">As explicitly mentioned in a number of the CVs, the IRA curated two entertainment-focused VK groups that published political information, which were still active as of September 2025 and each had more than 700,000 VK followers: <i>AKULA</i> (The Shark) (two mentions) and <i>Derzkii kvadrat</i> (Bold Square) (one mention). Both are also mentioned as being run by the IRA in the journalistic analysis of the leak of the data from the IRA’s IT department.<a href="#FN0018" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> The CVs also pointed to several popular YouTube channels operated by the IRA, which had not been removed from the platform by the company (deplatformed) at the time of writing (November 2025): <i>Znakom</i>’<i>tes’ Bob</i> (Meet Bob; 1.96 million subscribers, three mentions), <i>Chto, esli</i> (What If; 463,000 subscribers, three mentions), <i>Kratkaya istoriya</i> (Brief history; 833,000 subscribers, three mentions) and <i>CheBe</i> (BW; 93,400 subscribers, one mention, also mentioned in the IT department data leak).<a href="#FN0019" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <i>Chto, esli</i> and <i>Kratkaya istoriya</i> started producing new content in 2025.

According to journalistic reports, the IRA used this website to recruit US business owners as clients, using their businesses to make their fake accounts look legitimate (Holliday &amp; Barry <a href="#CIT0027" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0027" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>).</div></section><section id="sec-6-4-2"><h4>Technological tools used</h4><div role="paragraph">The 350 CVs analysed in this study provide a comprehensive overview of the technological tools used by the IRA. Key advertisement tools and services used in the departments of advertising include Google AdWords, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Yandex.Direct and Yandex.Metrics. The use of these tools indicates that the IRA ran sophisticated advertising campaigns and collected analytical and marketing data. IRA staff also used CPA (cost per action) advertising through tools such as Advertise, ActionPay, Everad and Admitad, and teaser networks (clickbait advertising networks) such as DirectAdvert, MarketGid and AdHub. As the CV data show, the IRA ran long-term ad campaigns in social media, created email subscription lists, worked with RTB (real-time bidding) systems, and even conducted focus groups.</div><div role="paragraph">In addition, the IRA used several in-house tools and technologies that made the simulation of user-generated content more efficient, including a synonymiser (a rewording tool) in the Russian language which resulted in a text difference of 25–35% (M, 33, programmer), a Telegram Bot which aggregated messages from various Telegram channels and sent them to a general channel with appropriate tags and categories, and a VK bot-service that was mentioned without explanation.</div></section><section id="sec-6-4-3"><h4>Collaboration with Prigozhin or Kremlin-affiliated organisations</h4><div role="paragraph">Finally, the CV data also indicate that the IRA closely operated with a series of media partners either affiliated with Prigozhin, the owner of IRA, or the Russian state. One CV (M, 29, CEO) mentioned receiving ‘a certificate of appreciation from the President of the Russian Federation for assistance in the preparation and conduct of election campaign events’ and ‘interaction with state supervisory authorities’ during his employment with the IRA. The IRA’s media partners included the Russian news websites Cont.ws and Politikus.info, and Prigozhin-affiliated websites such as Politpuzzle.ru, RIA FAN and <i>Nevskie novosti;</i> the latter two were part of Prigozhin’s PMG (Rusyayeva &amp; Zakharov <a href="#CIT0044" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0044" epub:type="biblioref">2017</a>). Collaborations with Russia’s state-owned media included buying content from the news agencies Ruptly and TASS, and partnership with online cinemas (2×2 and ivi.ru). Partnerships with foreign streaming networks (Roku, Zype, Opera TV) were also mentioned.</div></section></section></section><section id="sec-7" data-type="discussion"><h2>Discussion</h2><div role="paragraph">This study has generated a wealth of nuanced knowledge advancing research about the IRA specifically. Three of the most significant contributions are the following. To begin, this study is the first to provide reliable, highly detailed knowledge of the socio-demographics of the IRA workforce. Second, while our data allow no conclusions about the absolute numbers of the IRA’s workforce, this study is the first to be able to trace the evolution of the size of the IRA over almost a decade. Finally, while most of the existing literature focuses on IRA campaigns targeting the US presidential election, this may be misleading. Indeed, our data suggest that the IRA was not created primarily to target the US presidential election. Most of its staff were working on the Russian-language internet, including targeting Russian-speaking users in Ukraine against the broader background of the Russo–Ukrainian war (Dawson &amp; Innes <a href="#CIT0013" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0013" epub:type="biblioref">2019</a>).</div><div role="paragraph">This insight into the organisational characteristics of the IRA contributes to the global study of the information production industry. The importance of this understanding lies in the fact that when disinformation is industrialised, the actors of this industry are organised in the same way as other business units, hence, the organisation of the IRA is similar to that of a medium-sized media or PR company and includes, like any business, support staff such as office managers, cleaners, security and IT personnel. This allowed the IRA to carry out its long-term operations, while at the same time setting up small and ephemeral departments, which were untraceable in our CV data, to target foreign countries (such as US and Middle Eastern departments). To better understand the global disinformation-for-hire collectives, it is therefore also important to understand the infrastructure on which they rely. While this question is obvious in the case of state-owned units in China (Han <a href="#CIT0023" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0023" epub:type="biblioref">2015</a>) and Russia (DiResta <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0014" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0014" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>), it is more difficult to trace in the case of ‘outsourced’ units (DiResta <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0014" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0014" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>, p. 222).</div><div role="paragraph">This study highlights how smoothly the IRA network was integrated into the Russian ecosystem of public relations firms and (primarily) state-sponsored media outlets. As the CV data illustrate, the IRA was a reputable employer in the Russian labour market, with former IRA staff moving easily to other companies in sales and marketing, social media marketing and journalism (see RQ1). This finding technically locates it in the Russian media industry market, reflecting the findings of Ayeb and Bonini (<a href="#CIT0002" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0002" epub:type="biblioref">2024</a>), who locate such organisations (in their case, in the Arab world) in the media industry market of their respective countries. As we have seen, some IRA staff moved into new jobs in a media holding company comprising officially registered news outlets. In practice, however, it continued to host ‘troll’ operations under the guise of conventional journalism (Poliakoff <a href="#CIT0041" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0041" epub:type="biblioref">2025a</a>).</div><div role="paragraph">The IRA recruited mainly people in their early twenties, with little or no work experience, and with degrees from St Petersburg universities. The demographic availability of such a workforce could be one of the reasons for the growth of such an industry in recent years, especially in countries that do not qualify as fully consolidated liberal democracies. First, the location of such an organisation in a megacity makes it easier to hide and accessible to a large workforce. Secondly, if the media market is undersaturated it can attract fresh graduates looking for employment but who wish to stay in St Petersburg, even though the Russian media industry is concentrated in Moscow. Third, given the supply of underemployed graduates, who are often forced to take jobs that do not match their qualifications, such as working in fast food, retail or other service industries, there is a readily available pool of potential employees willing to accept lower wages and less stable employment conditions in order to do ‘creative’ work.</div><div role="paragraph">According to a common definition (Fetzer <a href="#CIT0017" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0017" epub:type="biblioref">2004</a>), the production of disinformation involves the deliberate dissemination of factually false claims. This study found that the operations of a disinformation production collective—in this case, the IRA—are not actually limited to disinformation <i>per se</i>. This corresponds to Harsin’s (<a href="#CIT0024" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0024" epub:type="biblioref">2024</a>) critique of disinformation-for-hire scholarship being too narrow, advocating that the scope encompass the ‘5Ps’: propaganda, PR, promotional culture, political consulting and post-truth. We see in our data that the IRA not only deliberately spread factually false claims but also sought to conceal its existence and its role in manufacturing and spreading those false claims from the public, which is not necessarily implied in standard definitions of disinformation.</div><div role="paragraph">In line with Harsin’s (<a href="#CIT0024" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0024" epub:type="biblioref">2024</a>) proposal we see that the IRA’s overarching mission encompassed a wide range of propaganda efforts, which we understand to be ‘deliberate, systematic attempts to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behaviour to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist’ (Jowett &amp; O’Donnell <a href="#CIT0028" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0028" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>, p. 7). Interestingly, the IRA engaged exclusively in covert (also known as ‘black’) propaganda, a classic subtype of propaganda that has two characteristics: first, ‘the source [of the messages] is concealed or attributed to a false authority’ and, second, it disseminates not only factually accurate content but also ‘lies, fabrications and deceptions’ (Jowett &amp; O’Donnell <a href="#CIT0028" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0028" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>, p. 18). Similarly, as our analysis of SNS accounts and media outlets run by the IRA shows, none of these accounts contained any indication that they were run by the IRA.</div><div role="paragraph">Moreover, there are obvious traces of another ‘P’ mentioned by Harsin (<a href="#CIT0024" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0024" epub:type="biblioref">2024</a>): we see that certain departments were doing direct PR and promotional work, setting up campaigns on global advertising platforms, which requires certain technical and professional skills not related to disinformation and propaganda. This contributes to a more complex understanding of the workers in the disinformation production industry: as we see in our dataset, the IRA not only employed ‘trolls’, who directed disinformation and propaganda work, but also professionals who helped them set up advertising campaigns, built the IT tools for content distribution, and navigated the world of political PR. As we see, the IRA has developed chatbots, which is consistent with reports that similar organisations in existence at the time of writing (October 2024) are employing AI specialists to perform these tasks (Darwish <a href="#CIT0011" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0011" epub:type="biblioref">2024</a>).</div><div role="paragraph">The covert nature of the IRA also leaves some questions not fully resolved. Previous research lacked a consensus on the IRA’s ownership. It has variously been referred to as a ‘private company’ (Bastos &amp; Farkas <a href="#CIT0003" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0003" epub:type="biblioref">2019</a>, p. 3; DiResta <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0014" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0014" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>, p. 222), an entity ‘reportedly linked to the Russian government’ (Bastos &amp; Farkas <a href="#CIT0003" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0003" epub:type="biblioref">2019</a>, p. 1), and as one ‘funded by the Russian government’ (Freelon <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0019" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0019" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>, p. 561). From the perspective of our CV data, the IRA appears as a genuinely private operation: we see no evidence of direct state control in its day-to-day activities, with employees circulating between different registered entities and moving into other media-related jobs under Prigozhin’s umbrella. Apart from the obvious connection of Prigozhin himself to Putin and the Russian government, the connection of the IRA to the state manifests itself in our data: peak recruitment coincided with Russia’s military campaigns over the last decade, the data also refer to campaigns that obviously benefitted Russian foreign and domestic policy and to the cooperation of the IRA with Russian state propaganda outlets. This distinguishes the IRA from disinformation production units in other authoritarian regimes, such as China, where numerous state agencies are often directly involved in sponsoring internet commentators, including local propaganda bureaus, ministries, and even schools and state-owned enterprises (Han <a href="#CIT0023" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0023" epub:type="biblioref">2015</a>) and also from other covert similar units within Russia that are integrated into the state apparatus, such as the propaganda units of Russian intelligence services (DiResta <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0014" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0014" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>). While we see that the IRA was never formally part of Russia’s official state structures, our data suggest that its activities were well-known to, and even honoured by, the state (as previously mentioned, the CEO of one the IRA companies received a certificate of appreciation from Putin).</div><div role="paragraph">The nature of funding is harder to identify through our data. Even if the IRA appears at a structural level to have been similar to a medium-sized media or PR agency, anything that might hint at sources of income are absent from the CVs. There is no mention of sales departments nor of any financial achievements by its staff (although our CV dataset does contain some minor references to commercial partnerships). Despite that, our dataset shows that the IRA performed tasks of strategic importance to the Russian government. We find no evidence in the data and existing literature (US Department of Justice <a href="#CIT0048" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048" epub:type="biblioref">2018</a>; DiResta <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0014" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0014" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>) that the IRA received direct payments or direct government contracts. The IRA’s financial resources were provided exclusively by the organisation’s principal, the Russian oligarch Prigozhin, who also ran a large catering company and the Wagner Group. Prigozhin’s entire fortune was made through his personal contact with Putin: his catering company won state tenders and the Wagner Group was financed by the state (Walker &amp; Sauer <a href="#CIT0049" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0049" epub:type="biblioref">2023</a>). There is no reason to believe that any of the IRA’s and Prigozhin’s actions before the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 were carried out without the approval of his patron in the Kremlin. The IRA’s primary goal—in addition to Prigozhin’s own business and power interests—can be described as securing the goodwill of Putin and Russia’s ruling elites; for example, getting more direct funding for either Prigozhin’s catering business or the Wagner Group. Therefore, we agree with the understanding of the IRA as the Kremlin’s ‘outsourced trolls’ (DiResta <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0014" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0014" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>, p. 222) rather than directly ‘funded by the Russian government’ (Freelon <i>et al</i>. <a href="#CIT0019" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0019" epub:type="biblioref">2022</a>, p. 561). Moreover, we can assume that the IRA’s role was similar to that of another product of ‘outsourcing’ activities to the same ‘agent’ (Prigozhin), the Wagner Group, ‘a component of Putin’s current “information warfare” strategy, using obfuscation in their relationship with the state to sow confusion and chaos among Russia’s enemies’ (Marten <a href="#CIT0037" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0037" epub:type="biblioref">2019</a>, p. 187).</div></section><section id="sec-8"><h2>Limitations and paths for future research</h2><div role="paragraph">Although self-published CVs provide detailed insights into the IRA’s structure, they offer a limited understanding of the feelings and perceptions of its workers. To improve future research, qualitative interviews, possibly with former IRA employees who left Russia after the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, could be beneficial.</div><div role="paragraph">The findings of this study solely pertain to the core IRA legal entities that were identified in the 2018 indictment by the US Department of Justice. Already since November 2014, the IRA’s head, Prigozhin, redirected a substantial portion of his disinformation campaigns towards organisations under the new umbrella of the newly created Patriot Media Group (PMG). For comparative analysis, one of the authors of this study examined and reviewed the CVs of PMG staff in a similar way to the IRA (Poliakoff <a href="#CIT0041" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0041" epub:type="biblioref">2025a</a>). Both the IRA and the PMG ceased to exist in June 2023, shortly after the uprising of the Wagner Group which has been widely referred to as Prigozhin’s ‘mutiny’. Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed two months later, on 23 August, in a plane crash near Kuzhenkino, Russia.</div><div role="paragraph">Although the empirical findings of this study are mainly descriptive, they could serve as a basis for further research into the global disinformation industry. As this study is the first to use this novel methodology, we urge researchers studying the global phenomena of disinformation-for-hire to implement it in other contexts. We believe that the combination of knowledge gained from studying the content produced by these organisations, the feelings and perceptions of their employees gathered through interviews, and the organisational structures provided in CVs can help us to better theorise this covert segment of the global media market.</div><div role="paragraph">As we pointed out in the article, the issue of IRA ownership cannot be resolved by using CV data alone. There is a need for a detailed study explaining the nature of the ‘outsourcing’ of disinformation activities in the case of Prigozhin, which would also help to understand the reasons why he mutinied against the Kremlin in 2023 and why he failed. We plan to examine this issue in detail in a future project using additional sources of data, including interviews and document analysis.</div></section></section><section id="backmatter" data-extent="backmatter" epub:type="backmatter"><section id="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><h2>Notes</h2><div role="doc-footnote" data-has="label" epub:type="footnote"><div class="label">1.</div><div id="FN0001" role="paragraph">For recent overviews of this literature, see, for example, DiResta <i>et al</i>.
